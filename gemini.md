# AIRA Project Plan & Technical Specification

**Project Name:** AIRA (Artificial Intelligence Real-estate Assets)
**Vision:** To democratize real estate investment for everyone, powered by AI-driven insights and blockchain transparency.
**Hackathon:** Crypto's Got Talent (CGT)

## 1\. Project Overview & Vision

AIRA is a next-generation Real World Asset (RWA) marketplace that makes investing in real estate as simple, liquid, and transparent as trading stocks. By converting physical properties into fractional NFT shares, we unlock a multi-trillion dollar asset class for retail investors globally.

Our unique advantage lies in the integration of a proprietary AI engine that provides users with institutional-grade analytics. This includes real-time property valuations, predictive market analysis, and a novel on-chain mortgage eligibility score, removing the guesswork and high barriers to entry that plague the traditional real estate market.

## 2\. Problem Statement

The global real estate market, despite its immense value, suffers from critical inefficiencies:

  - **Illiquidity:** Selling a property can take months, and capital is locked for years.
  - **High Barriers to Entry:** Prohibitively high capital requirements exclude the vast majority of potential investors.
  - **Opacity:** Access to reliable data for valuation and investment potential is often limited to industry insiders and institutions.
  - **Inefficient Processes:** Transactions are slow, expensive, and burdened by intermediaries.

## 3\. The AIRA Solution

AIRA solves these problems through a vertically integrated platform:

1.  **Tokenization & Fractionalization:** We convert single properties into thousands of tradable NFT shares (`ERC-1155`), enabling fractional ownership and providing instant liquidity through our marketplace.
2.  **AI-Driven Intelligence:** Our platform provides three core AI features:
      - **AIRA Valuation:** A dynamic, AI-powered valuation model that offers a fair market price for properties.
      - **AIRA Opportunity Map:** A predictive tool that visually identifies high-growth investment areas.
      - **AIRA Score:** A decentralized credit score assessing on-chain mortgage eligibility, bridging RWA with DeFi.
3.  **Blockchain Transparency:** All ownership records and transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain, and rental income is distributed automatically and transparently via smart contracts.

## 4\. Core Features Breakdown

### On-Chain Features

  - **Property Tokenization:** Minting a real-world property into a set number of `ERC-1155` tokens.
  - **Fractional NFT Marketplace:** A decentralized exchange to buy, sell, and trade property fractions.
  - **Automated Yield Distribution:** Smart contract to collect rental income (in `USDC`) and distribute it pro-rata to token holders.

### Off-Chain & Application Features

  - **Property Listings Portal:** A rich user interface to browse available properties with photos, legal docs (on IPFS), and financial details.
  - **Investor Portfolio Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard for users to track the value of their holdings, rental income, and overall portfolio performance.
  - **Secure Onboarding:** A streamlined process for property owners to submit their properties for verification and tokenization.

### AI-Powered Features

  - **AIRA Valuation Engine:** An interactive tool on each property page showing the AI-estimated value, historical trends, and key valuation drivers.
  - **AIRA Opportunity Map:** An interactive map interface with a heatmap overlay showing predicted rental yield and appreciation potential.
  - **AIRA Score Calculator:** A feature where users can connect their wallet to generate their on-chain credit score and see their potential eligibility for a loan to purchase fractions.
